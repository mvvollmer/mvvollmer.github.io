        <h2>Featured Projects</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout my academic and professional career, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to contribute to impactful research and develop innovative projects. Below are some highlights of my work.
        </p>

        <!-- Publication -->
        <h3>1. Machine Learning-Based Identification of Coral Pathogens</h3>
        <p>
            Published in *Environmental Microbiology*, this project focused on the use of machine learning techniques to identify putative bacterial pathogens affecting endangered Caribbean staghorn coral. By building highly accurate classifiers using 16S rDNA bacterial gene sequencing data, we achieved over 92% classification accuracy and contributed to coral conservation efforts.

            <li>Technologies used: Python, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, SHAP, Docker</li>
            <li>Published in *Environmental Microbiology* (2024): <a href="https://enviromicro-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1462-2920.16700">Read Publication</a></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Project 2 -->
        <h3>2. Traffic Data Extractor</h3>
        <p>
            A Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline designed to extract, preprocess, and categorize traffic violation reports from the Boston 311 API. By automating key issue identification such as bike lane obstructions, this project enhances urban planning and infrastructure management.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Technologies used: Python, Gensim, Scikit-Learn, REST APIs</li>
            <li>Built real-time data pipelines for traffic report processing.</li>
            <li>Automated identification of critical urban issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Project 3 -->
        <h3>3. Four-Person Chess AI</h3>
        <p>
            Developed a four-player chess AI using a custom Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, designed to compete against both random and experienced players. This project required the integration of game theory and advanced decision-making heuristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Technologies used: Python, Tkinter, Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning</li>
            <li>Achieved 100% win rate against random AIs and 50% win rate against experienced players.</li>
        </ul>
