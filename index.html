        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm <strong>Miles V. Vollmer</strong>, a dedicated Computer Science major at Northeastern University,
            focusing on <em>Artificial Intelligence</em>. My journey in the field of AI and machine learning has led me 
            to work on several exciting projects, including the development of models to predict coral disease and optimize 
            genome-wide association studies for COVID-19. These experiences have been equally challenging and rewarding, 
            allowing me to contribute to scientific research and technology in meaningful ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Northeastern, I’ve worked as a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> in the Evolutionary Genomics Lab, where
            I built machine learning models that achieved over 92% classification accuracy, contributing to ecological
            conservation efforts. My work has been published in <em>Environmental Microbiology</em>, focusing on using AI 
            to identify coral pathogens. I also worked at Mass General Hospital, where I optimized genetic pipelines 
            for COVID-19 data analysis, improving the efficiency of genome-wide association studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond academics, I enjoy a variety of interests such as <strong>soccer</strong> (co-captain of Northeastern FC), 
            <strong>surfing</strong>, <strong>scuba diving</strong>, and <strong>chess</strong>. These diverse activities keep
            me grounded and inspired.
        </p>
